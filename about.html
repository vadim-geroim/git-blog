          Hello,
          <br /> 
          My name is Vadim Geroim and I'm glad you visited this webpage. 

          Before we meet in person I would like to tell you about me and my experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
         My first programming language was Pascal when I learned to code and later on C. That was in my past years when I studied in a college. My first company where I worked as an automation engeneer used Java as a primary language for an automation framework so I had been working with Java for about two years by scripting API and UI automated tests.  Last year I got a good opportunity for my carrier and joined a new company. My first automation project was based on the Ruby language. This way I met Ruby first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like challenges and started to learn Ruby. This language was confusing to me because the last couple of years I primary worked with Java as we know the static language. Ruby was different. That difference made me curious and gave me the motivation to keep learning. I built an API automation project during the next couple of months. Sometimes I reached out rails developers to get feedback about my project. Finally, automated tests worked and I was happy to see green test report. That was just the very beginning of my journey with Rails. API testing required not only knowing how HTTP, Client-Server works but deep understanding about Rails framework. I started to learn little by little about routes, controllers, and models. But it was not easy and I decided to take an online course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed six months online course related to Ruby on Rails framework. When course was completed I desired to switch from automation engineering to web development. I was enrolled for Columbia University Online Bootcamp to get more experience and get more understanding about web development. I think Ruby and Rails the best choice for people who would like to start a carrier in web development. 
        </p> 
        <p>
          I have three years of coding experience with Java and Ruby automation frameworks and  a lot of experience with testing what can be a benefit for me during web development to deliver an application with less amount of bugs.  I live and work in NY. Please check out my projects and contact me to discuss new opportunities. I am looking forward to apply my skill and experience to build great applications with Rails. 
        </p>
